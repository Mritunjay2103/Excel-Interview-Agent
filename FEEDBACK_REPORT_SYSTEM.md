## Technical Implementation

### Report Generator Service
The `reportGeneratorService.js` provides comprehensive report generation capabilities:

#### Core Methods
- `generatePerformanceReport(sessionId, interviewState)` - Main report generation
- `createInterviewTranscript(interviewState, evaluations)` - Transcript creation
- `generateStructuredReport(interviewState, insights, evaluations, transcript)` - LLM-powered report
- `generateFallbackReport(interviewState, insights, evaluations)` - Rule-based fallback

#### LLM Integration
```javascript
// Generate comprehensive report using LLM
const prompt = this.createReportPrompt(interviewState, insights, evaluations, transcript);
const response = await llmService.generateResponse(prompt);
const structuredReport = this.parseStructuredReport(response.content, interviewState, insights);
```

#### Fallback System
When LLM is unavailable, the system generates reports using:
- **Grade Calculation** - A+ to F based on score ranges
- **Category Analysis** - Performance breakdown by Excel topics
- **Trend Detection** - Improving/declining/stable patterns
- **Recommendation Generation** - Based on performance patterns

### Transcript System
Complete interview session capture:

#### Session Information
- **Candidate Details** - Name, session ID, topic, difficulty
- **Timing Data** - Start time, end time, duration
- **Statistics** - Total questions, answered, correct, accuracy

#### Question-Answer Pairs
- **Question Details** - Text, category, difficulty, expected answer
- **User Answers** - Complete response text and timestamp
- **Evaluations** - Detailed scoring and feedback
- **Performance Metrics** - Individual scores and analysis

### Storage System
Persistent storage for reports and transcripts:

#### File Structure
```
backend/data/reports/
├── report_sessionId1.json
├── report_sessionId2.json
└── ...
```

#### Data Format
```json
{
  "sessionId": "session_123",
  "report": { /* structured report data */ },
  "transcript": { /* complete transcript data */ },
  "generatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "type": "performance_report"
  }
}
```
