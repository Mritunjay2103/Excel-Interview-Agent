# Agentic Behavior System

## Overview
The Mock Excel Interviewer now features an intelligent adaptive agent that uses LangChain Memory to maintain user context across interview turns and dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on performance patterns.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  **LangChain Memory Integration**
- **Persistent User Context** - Maintains conversation history and user profile
- **Performance Tracking** - Tracks scores, strengths, weaknesses across sessions
- **Adaptive Learning** - Learns from user patterns to improve question selection
- **Session Persistence** - Saves and restores user context between sessions

### ðŸŽ¯ **Dynamic Question Selection**
- **Performance-Based Adaptation** - Adjusts difficulty based on recent performance
- **Category Targeting** - Focuses on weak areas while reinforcing strengths
- **Intelligent Reasoning** - AI explains why specific questions are selected
- **Real-time Adjustment** - Adapts after each answer evaluation

### ðŸ“Š **Advanced Performance Analysis**
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring** - Tracks correctness, depth, and clarity separately
- **Trend Analysis** - Identifies improving, declining, or stable performance patterns
- **Strengths & Weaknesses** - Automatically categorizes user capabilities
- **Adaptation Levels** - Quantifies how much difficulty should change

## Memory System Architecture

### InterviewMemory Class
```javascript
class InterviewMemory extends BaseMemory {
  // User profile tracking
  userProfile: {
    performanceHistory: [],      // All evaluation scores
    difficultyProgression: [],   // Difficulty changes over time
    strengths: [],              // Strong categories/aspects
    weaknesses: [],             // Weak categories/aspects
    currentDifficulty: string,   // Current difficulty level
    totalQuestions: number,      // Questions answered
    correctAnswers: number,      // Correct answers
    averageScore: number         // Overall performance
  }
  
  // Context tracking
  context: {
    currentTopic: string,        // Current interview topic
    questionCategories: [],      // Categories covered
    recentAnswers: [],          // Last 5 answers
    performanceTrend: string,    // 'improving' | 'declining' | 'stable'
    adaptationLevel: number      // -1 (easier) | 0 (same) | 1 (harder)
  }
}
```

### Memory Persistence
- **Session Storage** - Each interview session has its own memory
- **File-based Persistence** - Memory saved to JSON files
- **Automatic Loading** - Memory restored when session resumes
- **Cross-session Learning** - User profile persists across multiple interviews

## Adaptive Question Selection

### Performance Analysis Algorithm
1. **Recent Performance** - Analyzes last 3 answers for trends
2. **Score Thresholds** - 85+ = increase difficulty, 60- = decrease difficulty
3. **Category Analysis** - Identifies weak areas for targeted questions
4. **Trend Detection** - Recognizes improving/declining patterns

### Question Selection Logic
```javascript
// Difficulty adjustment based on performance
if (averageScore >= 85) {
  nextDifficulty = increaseDifficulty(currentDifficulty);
  reasoning = "You're excelling! Increasing difficulty to challenge you further.";
} else if (averageScore <= 60) {
  nextDifficulty = decreaseDifficulty(currentDifficulty);
  reasoning = "Adjusting to easier level to build confidence.";
} else {
  nextDifficulty = currentDifficulty;
  reasoning = "Maintaining current difficulty level.";
}

// Category selection based on weaknesses
if (weaknesses.length > 0) {
  recommendedCategory = getMostFrequentWeakness(weaknesses);
} else {
  recommendedCategory = randomCategory(); // Continue learning
}
```

## AI-Powered Features

### Intelligent Reasoning
The agent generates explanations for question selection:
- **Performance Analysis** - "Based on your 85% average score..."
- **Difficulty Justification** - "I'm increasing difficulty because..."
- **Category Focus** - "Focusing on pivot tables to strengthen weak areas"
- **Encouragement** - "You're improving with each question!"

### Adaptive Feedback
Personalized feedback based on:
- **Current Performance** - Immediate score and analysis
- **Historical Context** - Comparison to previous answers
- **Learning Progress** - Recognition of improvement patterns
- **Motivational Elements** - Encouragement and guidance
