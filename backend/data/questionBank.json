      "category": "formulas",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "question": "What is VLOOKUP and how do you use it?",
      "expectedAnswer": "VLOOKUP is a function that searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column. Syntax: VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])",
      "keyPoints": ["lookup value", "table array", "column index", "exact match", "approximate match"],
      "example": "VLOOKUP(A2, B2:E10, 3, FALSE) looks up A2 in column B and returns the value from column D (3rd column)"

      "category": "formulas",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "question": "Explain the IF function and provide an example.",
      "expectedAnswer": "The IF function performs a logical test and returns one value if TRUE and another if FALSE. Syntax: IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)",
      "keyPoints": ["logical test", "true value", "false value", "nested IF", "logical operators"],
      "example": "IF(A1>50, 'Pass', 'Fail') returns 'Pass' if A1 is greater than 50, otherwise 'Fail'"

      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "question": "What is the difference between SUM and SUMIF? When would you use SUMIF?",
      "expectedAnswer": "SUM adds all values in a range, while SUMIF adds values that meet specific criteria. SUMIF is useful for conditional summing based on criteria in another column.",
      "keyPoints": ["conditional summing", "criteria", "range", "sum_range", "wildcards"],
      "example": "SUMIF(A1:A10, '>100', B1:B10) sums values in B1:B10 where corresponding A values are greater than 100"

      "difficulty": "advanced",
      "question": "Explain INDEX and MATCH functions and how they work together. Why might you use them instead of VLOOKUP?",
      "expectedAnswer": "INDEX returns a value from a specific position in a range. MATCH finds the position of a value in a range. Together, they can look up values more flexibly than VLOOKUP, allowing left-to-right and right-to-left lookups.",
      "keyPoints": ["index function", "match function", "flexible lookup", "left lookup", "array formulas"],
      "example": "INDEX(C1:C10, MATCH(A1, B1:B10, 0)) finds A1 in column B and returns corresponding value from column C"
